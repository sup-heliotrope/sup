* Maildir Syncback has now been merged into main sup! This is a
  long-time waiting feature initially developed by Damien Leone,
  then picked up by Edward Z. Yang who continued development. Additionally
  several others have been contributing.

  Eventually, recently, Eric Weikl has picked up this branch, modernized
  it to current sup, maintained it and gotten it ready for release.

  Main authors:

  Damien Leone
  Edward Z. Yang
  Eric Weikl

  Not all of the features initially proposed have been included. This is
  to maintain compatibility with more operating systems and wait with
  the more daring features to make sure sup is stable-ish.

  This is a big change since sup now can modify your mail (!), please
  back up your mail and your configuration before using the maildir
  syncback feature. For instructions on how to migrate an existing
  maildir source or how to set up a new one, refer to the wiki:

  https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/sup/wiki/Using-sup-with-other-clients

  It is possible to both disable maildir syncback globally (default:
  disabled) and per-source (default: enabled).

* Sup on Ruby 2.0.0 now works - but beware, this has not been very throughly
  tested. Patches are welcome.

* We are now using our own rmail-sup gem with fixes for Ruby 2.0.0 and
  various warnings fixed.

* sup-sync-back has been renamed to sup-sync-back-mbox to conform with
  the other sync-back scripts.

* You can now save attachments to directories without specifying the full
  filename (default filename is used).

* Various encoding fixes and minor bug fixes
