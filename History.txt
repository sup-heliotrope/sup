  Ruby 3+. (Gui Goncalves)
* OutOfSyncSourceErrors now show an error message in the thread view in place

  skipped if the SUP_SKIP_XAPIAN_GEM_INSTALL environment variable is set.
  Previously it was skipped unconditionally on OpenBSD only. (Dan Callaghan)

== 1.1 / 2022-05-23

* #588, #577: Sup is now compatible with and tested on Ruby 3.0 and Ruby 3.1.
  (Dan Callaghan)
* When the Sup gem installs xapian-ruby, it will install to the user gem
  directory if the system gem directory is not writable. (Iain Parris)

  recommendation. (Dan Callaghan)
* Sup now decodes UTF-7 correctly instead of crashing. (Dan Callaghan)

== 1.0 / 2020-07-12

No changes. The version number is incremented to 1.0 to reflect the fact that

== 0.23 / 2020-07-10

* #505: Shell metacharacters in attachment filenames are no longer escaped when
  saving the attachment to disk using 's'. Fixes attachments being saved with
  unnecessary \ escapes in their filename. (Felix Van der Jeugt)
* When saving attachments, Sup now creates all parent directories of the
  destination path. (Matthieu Rakotojaona)
* The '@' key now reloads all messages in thread view. (Seva Zhidkov)
* #517: The 'g' key now correctly opens each selected URL if multiple URLs are
  under the cursor, instead of opening the last URL multiple times.
  (Matthieu Rakotojaona)
* The 'g' key now works when the cursor is over a URL inside a signature block.
  (Michael Dwyer)
* The 'reply-to' hook is now passed a 'message' variable, the message being
  replied to, so that the hook can choose the reply mode based on properties of
  the message like the list address. (Simon Tatham)
* The contacts list now shows also email addresses supplied by the
  'extra-contract-addresses' hook. (Matthieu Rakotojaona)
* #510: The micalg= parameter is now set correctly when sending
  multipart/signed messages. Fixes issues with other mail clients which fail to
  handle a missing micalg= parameter on signed messages. (Dan Callaghan)
* Attachments with text/plain MIME type are now correctly decoded according to
  their charset= parameter. (Dan Callaghan)
* Strings returned by the 'mime-decode' hook are now kept in their original
  encoding and displayed as is, instead of being wrongly transcoded.
  (Dan Callaghan)
* Rendering speed of thread list views is improved. (Vickenty Fesunov)
* Fixed display width calculation for emoji. Previously, sender names and
  thread subjects using emoji would be incorrectly truncated, if the terminal
  emulator displays emoji as double-width. (Dan Callaghan)
* List address is parsed from the non-standard Mailing-List header used by
  Groups.io. (Dan Callaghan)
* Fixed misinterpretation of quoted text where the quote uses both an
  "---- Original Message ----" marker and > delimiters, for example from
  Zimbra users. (Steven Lawrance)
* Added a new option 'indent_spaces' in config.yaml, to control the number of
  spaces for indenting each child message when displaying the thread view.
  The default remains 2. (Antoni Kaniowski)
* Attachment sizes are now displayed using standard unit abbreviations like
  "MiB". (Sharif Olorin)
* Sup now gives a hint if a search query results in an empty search after
  tokenization (for example, if the user tries to search for only punctuation).
  (Per Andersson)
* The --list-hooks option now takes an additional option --hooks-matching, to
  filter the listed hooks. (Matthieu Rakotojaona)
* Fixed ArgumentError in logging methods on Ruby 2.7. (Dan Callaghan)
* Fixed FrozenError in verified_ok? method on Ruby 2.7. (Iain Parris)
* Fixed Fixnum deprecation warnings on Ruby 2.4+. (Dan Callaghan)

* Maildir Syncback has now been merged into main sup! This is a
  long-time waiting feature initially developed by Damien Leone,
  then picked up by Edward Z. Yang who continued development. Additionally
  several others have been contributing.

  Eventually, recently, Eric Weikl has picked up this branch, modernized
  it to current sup, maintained it and gotten it ready for release.

  Main authors:

  Damien Leone
  Edward Z. Yang
  Eric Weikl

  Not all of the features initially proposed have been included. This is
  to maintain compatibility with more operating systems and wait with
  the more daring features to make sure sup is stable-ish.

  This is a big change since sup now can modify your mail (!), please
  back up your mail and your configuration before using the maildir
  syncback feature. For instructions on how to migrate an existing
  maildir source or how to set up a new one, refer to the wiki:

  https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/sup/wiki/Using-sup-with-other-clients

  It is possible to both disable maildir syncback globally (default:
  disabled) and per-source (default: enabled).

* Sup on Ruby 2.0.0 now works - but beware, this has not been very throughly
  tested. Patches are welcome.

* We are now using our own rmail-sup gem with fixes for Ruby 2.0.0 and
  various warnings fixed.

* sup-sync-back has been renamed to sup-sync-back-mbox to conform with
  the other sync-back scripts.

* You can now save attachments to directories without specifying the full
  filename (default filename is used).

* Various encoding fixes and minor bug fixes
