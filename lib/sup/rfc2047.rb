#
# An implementation of RFC 2047 decoding.
#
# This module depends on the iconv library by Nobuyoshi Nakada, which I've
# heard may be distributed as a standard part of Ruby 1.8. Many thanks to him
# for helping with building and using iconv.
#
# Thanks to "Josef 'Jupp' Schugt" <jupp / gmx.de> for pointing out an error with
# stateful character sets.
