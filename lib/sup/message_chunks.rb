## Here we define all the "chunks" that a message is parsed
## into. Chunks are used by ThreadViewMode to render a message. Chunks
## are used for both MIME stuff like attachments, for Sup's parsing of
## the message body into text, quote, and signature regions, and for
## notices like "this message was decrypted" or "this message contains
## a valid signature"---basically, anything we want to differentiate
## at display time.
##
## A chunk can be inlineable, expandable, or viewable. If it's
## inlineable, #color and #lines are called and the output is treated
## as part of the message text. This is how Text and one-line Quotes
## and Signatures work.
##
## If it's not inlineable but is expandable, #patina_color and
## #patina_text are called to generate a "patina" (a one-line widget,
## basically), and the user can press enter to toggle the display of
## the chunk content, which is generated from #color and #lines as
## above. This is how Quote, Signature, and most widgets
## work. Exandable chunks can additionally define #initial_state to be
## :open if they want to start expanded (default is to start collapsed).
##
## If it's not expandable but is viewable, a patina is displayed using
## #patina_color and #patina_text, but no toggling is allowed. Instead,
## if #view! is defined, pressing enter on the widget calls view! and
## (if that returns false) #to_s. Otherwise, enter does nothing. This
##  is how non-inlineable attachments work.
##
## Independent of all that, a chunk can be quotable, in which case it's
## included as quoted text during a reply. Text, Quotes, and mime-parsed
## attachments are quotable; Signatures are not.

## monkey-patch time: make temp files have the right extension
## Backport from Ruby 1.9.2 for versions lower than 1.8.7

  class Attachment
    HookManager.register "mime-decode", <<EOS
Decodes a MIME attachment into text form. The text will be displayed
directly in Sup. For attachments that you wish to use a separate program
to view (e.g. images), you should use the mime-view hook instead.

Variables:
   content_type: the content-type of the attachment
        charset: the charset of the attachment, if applicable
       filename: the filename of the attachment as saved to disk
  sibling_types: if this attachment is part of a multipart MIME attachment,
                 an array of content-types for all attachments. Otherwise,
                 the empty array.
Return value:
  The decoded text of the attachment, or nil if not decoded.
EOS

    HookManager.register "mime-view", <<EOS
Views a non-text MIME attachment. This hook allows you to run
third-party programs for attachments that require such a thing (e.g.
images). To instead display a text version of the attachment directly in
Sup, use the mime-decode hook instead.

Note that by default (at least on systems that have a run-mailcap command),
Sup uses the default mailcap handler for the attachment's MIME type. If
you want a particular behavior to be global, you may wish to change your
mailcap instead.

Variables:
   content_type: the content-type of the attachment
       filename: the filename of the attachment as saved to disk
Return value:
  True if the viewing was successful, false otherwise. If false, calling
  /usr/bin/run-mailcap will be tried.
