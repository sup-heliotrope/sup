If you're the type of person who treats email as an extension of your long-term memory, Sup is for you.  Sup makes it easy to: - Handle massive amounts of email.  - Mix email from different sources: mbox files (even across different machines), Maildir directories, POP accounts, and GMail accounts.  - Instantaneously search over your entire email collection. Search over body text, or use a query language to combine search predicates in any way.  - Handle multiple accounts. Replying to email sent to a particular account will use the correct SMTP server, signature, and from address.  - Add custom code to handle certain types of messages or to handle certain types of text within messages.  - Organize email with user-defined labels, automatically track recent contacts, and much more!  The goal of Sup is to become the email client of choice for nerds everywhere.}
