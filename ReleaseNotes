Release 0.9.1:

This is mainly a bugfix release, with a couple minor new features rolled up.

If you are using the Ferret backend, consider convering soon. I will probably
add a deprecation notice in 0.10, and you support will be dropped in 0.11.

Release 0.9:

There's a new Xapian backend as an alternative to the Ferret one. It's still in
a beta stage. It's much faster and much less prone to the random crashes than
Ferret, but certain things don't work yet, most noticeably the unread message
counts in label-list-mode.

You can switch back and forth between both indexes without harm, *except* any
new messages added to the one index won't be picked up by the other. Follow
these instructions:

To TRY the Xapian index, without screwing Ferret up:

1. sup-dump > dump                              # takes a while
2. export SUP_INDEX=xapian                      # or however you do it in your shell
3. sup-sync --all --all-sources --restore dump  # takes a long time
4. sup -n                # -n ensures that no polling is done. don't hit 'P' either

Step 1 will take a long time, and step 3 will take a very long time.

At this point, whenever you run Sup, the SUP_INDEX environment variable will
determine which index you use. If it's unset, or "ferret", you will use the
ferret index. If it's "xapian", the Xapian index. Make sure when you run sup
with the Xapian index, you use -n and don't hit 'P', to avoid loading new
messages into it.

If you want to switch to Xapian permanently, you can then:

1. rm -rf ~/.sup/ferret
2. permanently set SUP_INDEX=xapian according to your shell
3. Run sup as normal, i.e. without -n.

If you want to go back to Ferret, you can just rm -rf ~/.sup/xapian and make
sure your SUP_INDEX environment variable is unset.

Release 0.8.1:

A bugfix release with fixes for quote parsing (bad behavior in certain long
emails), multibyte display for non-utf8 locales, and reply-mode mode selection.

Release 0.8:

The big wins are undo support, mbox splitting fixes, and the various UI
speedups and bugfixes. Parsing new email should also be faster, although
IMAP remains tragically slow, as usual.

Release 0.7:

The big win in this release is that Ferret index corruption issues should now
be fixed, thanks to an extensive programming of locking and
thread-safety-adding.

The other nice change is that text entry will now scroll to the right upon
overflow, thanks to some arcane Curses magic that Steve Goldman discovered.

As always, this release includes many other bugfixes and enhancements.

Release 0.6:

Message attachment searchability automatically takes effect on new messages,
but if you want it on older ones, you'll have to reindex them. See the
instructions below, and the help for sup-sync, for how to do this.

Release 0.5:

Saving message state (pressing "$") has been sped up. However, this is only
automatically in effect for new messages. To make it effective for older
messages (i.e. messages indexed with versions of Sup before 0.5), you must
reindex them, e.g. by running sup-sync --all on a source.
